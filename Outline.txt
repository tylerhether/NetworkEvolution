Generatl Outline for Simulation:



Initialize Everything:
    Create Populations
        Create individuals
        Create loci
        Create coding and regulatory alleles
            Seed coding and reg alleles so that the populations' mean phenotype is at a given position in phenotypic space
Recursion:
    Selectively asses hybrid fitness
        Get hybrid fitness
    Selection
        Get fitness
        Cull individuals based of fitness
    Mating
        Random Mating
        Recombination
    Migration
        Migrate Individuals following a pull-ball model
    Summary Statistics
        Output data
